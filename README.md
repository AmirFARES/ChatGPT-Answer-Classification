## Introduction üåü

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio! This repository showcases my participation in the ChatGPT Answer Classification Challenge. In this challenge, I developed a model to classify answers as either ChatGPT-generated or human-written.

## About the Challenge üåê

This challenge is part of the ML Olympiad organized by IEEE ESSTHS Student Branch, IEEE ESSTHS CIS SBC, GDSC ISETSo, and PyData Tunisia. It focuses on detecting AI-generated answers, a critical task in today's AI-driven world.

### Challenge Details üìù

- **Goal**: Classify answers into ChatGPT-generated or human-written categories.
- **Datasets**: I worked with a dataset containing prompts (questions) and answers, where some answers were generated by ChatGPT and others by humans.
- **Evaluation**: The performance metric for this competition was accuracy.

## Project Files üìÇ

Here are the key files related to this project:

- [**train.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-detect-chatgpt-answers/data) - The training dataset containing prompts and answers with ground truth labels.
- [**test.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-detect-chatgpt-answers/data) - The test dataset for making predictions.
- [**sample_submission.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-detect-chatgpt-answers/data) - A sample submission file with the required format.
- [**notebook in Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirfares/chat-gpt-vs-human) or [**chat-gpt-vs-human.ipynb**](./chat-gpt-vs-human.ipynb) - My Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and model implementation.

## My Approach üöÄ

1. **Data Exploration**: I started by exploring the training dataset to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

2. **Feature Engineering**: I engineered features and performed text preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling.

3. **Model Selection**: I experimented with various machine learning and NLP models to find the best-performing one.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To optimize model performance, I fine-tuned hyperparameters.

5. **Validation**: I used cross-validation techniques to assess model accuracy and robustness.

6. **Submission**: After obtaining satisfactory results, I created submission files for evaluation.

For detailed implementation and analysis, please refer to my [notebook](./chat-gpt-vs-human.ipynb).

## Results üìà

I ranked among the top 20 participants in the ML Olympiad's ChatGPT Answer Classification Challenge. My model successfully classified answers, contributing to the transparency and credibility of AI-generated content.

## Future Steps üå±

As I continue to build my expertise in data science and machine learning, I plan to:

- Explore advanced NLP techniques for even better classification.
- Incorporate additional data sources to enhance model accuracy.
- Improve model interpretability for practical applications.
